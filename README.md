## Overview

Globetrotter Challenge is designed to provide a fun, engaging, and secure gaming experience by combining a Spring Boot backend with a React frontend. The backend is built using Java, Spring Boot, Maven, and MySQL (hosted on Railway), while the frontend is a React app styled with Material-UI and deployed on Netlify.

## Tech Stack & Choices

  - **Spring Boot:** Provides a robust and scalable framework for building RESTful APIs.
  - **Maven:** Manages dependencies and builds the Java application.
  - **MySQL:** Stores game data, user scores, and destination details. Deployed using a free service like Railway.
  - **Hibernate/JPA:** Handles object-relational mapping and database operations.
  - **ClearDB/Railway MySQL:** Free database hosting solution.

  - **React:** Creates a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) for a responsive user experience.
  - **Material-UI:** Provides pre-built UI components and consistent styling.
  - **Axios:** Handles API requests from the frontend to the backend.
  - **Netlify:** Free hosting for static sites, ideal for deploying React apps.
